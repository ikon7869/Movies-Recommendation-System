Movie Recommendation System 

This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferred movie titles. By utilizing cosine similarity, the system offers a seamless experience for discovering new movies aligned with users' tastes.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a movie recommendation system that leverages cosine similarity to deliver tailored movie recommendations to users, enhancing their movie-watching journey and introducing them to films they may not have encountered otherwise.

How It Works
Data Collection and Preprocessing: The project begins by collecting a dataset comprising movie titles and their associated tags or metadata. The collected data is preprocessed by eliminating stopwords, tokenizing text, and converting movie tags into numerical representations using the CountVectorizer technique.

Feature Extraction and Similarity Calculation: Using CountVectorizer, movie tags are transformed into numerical vectors. Cosine similarity is then calculated between these vectors to measure the similarity between different movies within the dataset.

Model Building: A recommendation function is constructed to take a user's selected movie as input. By identifying the index of the chosen movie in the dataset, the corresponding vector is retrieved. Cosine similarities between the selected movie's vector and vectors of all other movies are computed.

Recommendation Generation: The system identifies the top N movies with the highest cosine similarity scores to the selected movie. The selected movie itself is excluded from the list, and the movie list is sorted in descending order of similarity scores.

User Interface and Interaction: A user-friendly interface is implemented, allowing users to input their favorite movie title. Based on the user's input, the system displays the top recommended movies, enabling users to explore new movies that align with their preferences.

How to Use
Data Preparation: Gather a dataset containing movie titles and tags. Preprocess the data to eliminate stopwords and tokenize text. Utilize CountVectorizer to transform movie tags into numerical vectors.

Model Building: Implement the recommendation function to calculate cosine similarities and generate personalized movie suggestions based on user input.

User Interface: Use the provided user interface to input your favorite movie title. Receive a list of top recommended movies that share similarities with your preferred choice.

By implementing this movie recommendation system, users can embark on a journey of cinematic exploration, uncovering movies that resonate with their preferences and enhancing their overall movie-watching experience.
